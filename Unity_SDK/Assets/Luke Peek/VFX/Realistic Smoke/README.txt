Thanks for purchasing my Realistic Smoke set!

If you haven’t already, import the package into your Unity 3D project by double clicking the .unitypackage file and then click the 'import' button. Make sure all files are selected, the demo scene can be un-ticked if you don’t want to make use of it.

Using the prefabs:

Simply drag a prefab from the prefabs folder into your scene. External forces are on by default so the smoke is affected by wind in your scene. To turn this off simply un-tick ‘External Forces’ in the inspector with a prefab selected.


All particle systems are editable. Enjoy!
